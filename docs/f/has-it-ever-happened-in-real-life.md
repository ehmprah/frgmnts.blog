The father and his children sat on the couch and casually watched a TV show. They were a commenting bunch, in the cinema they'd have been shushed a dozen times already. The TV show on the screen dramatically depicted a wedding where a woman stood up at the worst possible time, declared her love for the groom and ran off with him. One of the boys was annoyed and said how the show stupid and c'mon, has it ever happened in real life? The father got up and left the room too quickly to not arouse suspicion. Dad?, what's up? asked the boy towards the door, got no answer, and asked his siblings quietly wether he had said something wrong. They shrugged and said probably not because Mum and nobody stood up and their wedding, right?
