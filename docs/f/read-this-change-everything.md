I have recently finished reading ["Change Everything"](https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/change-everything/) by Austrian economist Christian Felber: a visionary, wholesome book about an alternative economic system, a manual for a better world which I cannot recommend enough.

After a jawdroppingly precise analysis of how and why your world is economically fucked and tears us apart on the inside, the author goes on to create a surprisingly realistic vision of an alternative economic model.

This "Economy of the Common Good" rewards cooperation instead of competition, puts people and planet first and profits second. Money in this system is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself anymore.

Democratic processes play an important role in the book: not only because our democracies are similarly fucked as our economies, as they're inherently entwined — but because Felber defers many details of the Economy of the Common Good to the future, to be decided on in democratic processes.

And to top it all off Felber keeps it all very reasonable, realistic and realizable. He wants to change the world and doesn't shy away from giving you step by step instructions on how to do it. Heck, it's actually been going on for years, you'll be amazed by the book and by the progress this idea has already made. I most certainly was and would call this book the most important piece of nonfiction I've read in at least ten years if not ever. Read [this](https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/change-everything/) – and let us indeed change everything!
