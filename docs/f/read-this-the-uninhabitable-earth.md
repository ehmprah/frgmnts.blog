In order to fight the monster we've created with climate change, we must first see it for what it is. Climate change is turning into a climate crisis in the public eye, we are starting to realize just how big of a problem this is. But we're still far away from grasping it fully. Until we've read ["The Uninhabitable Earth"](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans-annotated.html) by David Wallace-Wells. The lengthy essay gives us an up-to-date scientific overview of what climate change will do to us in this century and why, sprinkled with some journalistic pathos. The essay is bleak, but our future is, too. Go read up and act accordingly.
