This is the first post to my first blog! Quite weird to be writing that as a digital native and as someone who has built dozens of websites over the past years. But heck, better late than never!

What you can expect from this blog: little written pieces ("fragments") with topics ranging from personal to philosophical to political â€“ written by yours truly and maybe even a guest or two.

If you want to know who I am, why this blog is called FRGMNTS or why I'm writing it in English, head over to the <a href="/about.html">about</a> page. Otherwise just bookmark this thing (or follow me below) and come back soon!
