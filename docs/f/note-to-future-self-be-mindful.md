Remember how you felt when you were actively trying to practice mindfulness? You probably have forgotten because you were busy with things: but if you can't take the time to contemplate and do something slowly and attentively every now and then, you'll end up dissolving yourself in the process. You can't always push the boulder: you have to watch it roll down again.

Remember how mindfulness enriches everything with a substance â€“ the absence of which you might have started to notice as the void creeps in around you. Sometimes a mindful breath is force enough to make your dissolving fragments gravitate towards you again. Try to be mindful. It probably even prevents cancer or something.
