I've recently discovered a wonderful Netflix show: [Chef's Table](https://www.netflix.com/title/80007945). At first it looks like food-pornographic infotainment. Halfway through the first epsiode you realize that at its heart the show is rather a documentary about the people making excellent food.

To achieve excellency in any craft is a truly challenging experience in my opinion, so the people who make excellent food are naturally very interesting people with tons of stories to tell and wisdom to share. And portraying those people, in part raw, in part neatly arranged, with some brilliant food photography on the side makes for a very inspiring and enjoyable format to watch.
