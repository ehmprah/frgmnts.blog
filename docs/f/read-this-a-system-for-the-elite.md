I've recently stumbled upon a masterful write-up of what's wrong with modern capitalism: ten years after the financial crisis, Heike Buchter summarizes that the shareholder-value doctrine lead to the crisis. It's the values we have chosen economically and politically which are responsible for the crash and those haven't changed at all in the past ten years.

But that's not only bad news in my opinion: that doesn't mean the system is wrong in and of itself, it's just the wrong values we've set as the goals for the system. We're an inventive bunch, we can probably find values that better suit us, can't we? Anyway, the article is short and brilliant, so read this: [Financial Crisis: A System for the Elite](https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2018-09/financial-crisis-lehman-shareholder-value-doctrine-english).
