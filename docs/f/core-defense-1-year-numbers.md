It has been exactly one year since [Core Defense](https://coredefense.ehmprah.com/) was released on Steam and in this post I'll share with you both the hard numbers as well as the lessons I learned along the way.

Before we get to the actual numbers, I'll give you a quick recap of the game's history, especially of the things I did after the release on Steam:

- Core Defense was released as first access on itch.io six months prior to the release, where it sold 106 units and grossed $1,144
- Core Defense was released on Steam on July 31, 2020 at a $9.99 price point, had 3632 wishlists before the launch, sold 2,546 units and grossed $20,186 in the first week on Steam
- I've since built 25 patches (3 of which were big content updates)
- Released the Mastery Expansion DLC on Steam on March 19, 2021 at a $4.99 price point
- Released the iOS & Android versions of the game on April 21, 2021 with a freemium business model, unlocking the full game at a $4.99 price point, the expansion for $2.99 and a bundle for both priced at $6.99

## Grand total

Across all platforms Core Defense has grossed $XX.XXX in the past year. I will break down this grand total per platform below.

## Windows vs Mac and Linux

As an avid Linux user, I always wonder why so few developers publish their games for operating systems other than Windows. Looking at the sales of Core Defense, it makes a little more sense: Mac and Linux account for only 8.5% of sales. In my case, packaging the game for these OS was virtually no extra effort, so it made sense – but if it's additional work, it may very well be not worth the effort.

## Localization

I think that localizing Core Defense was an important part of the game's success: about 50% of sales come from non-English speaking countries. But I'm really unhappy with the state and the quality of the translations. The [enthusiasm I previously shared](/f/how-make-successful-indie-game.html) has subsided over the past year for various reasons:

- the quality of the crowdsourced translations is mostly sub-par
- while there was a lot of momentum around the launch it quickly faded after a while, leaving me with half-finished translations as I introduced new content
- I made quite a few mistakes in organizing the strings, leading to an unnecessary amount to translate, further reducing motivation for the translators
- I didn't funnel translators through the Discord server to be able to reach them

While the localizations helped me sell the game, they don't keep the promise they made in the game itself. I would surely have sold fewer copies of the game without them, but enough to make a professional translation worth it – I don't know. One of the two games I'm currently working on ([Thousand Lives](https://thousandlives.ehmprah.com/)) will be a narrative game that probably won't be localized and I can't wait to see (and share) the numbers in that case.
