When he decided to go fully cybernetic, he had been happy for a long time. He was considerably rich and needed to be: despite cybernetic modification having become a mass market, embedding your brain in a state-of-the-art cybernetic body still was very costly.

But his family was taken care of anyway thanks to several trusts and he was enjoying the financial freedom of an accomplished older man who can spend money like a little boy.

He had had several cybernetic implants before, an artificial eye as well a blood and vital monitor; but it was the "pistol" replacement of his right thumb and index which sparked the idea of going fully cybernetic. Being able to hold your own weight with just your index finger made him wonder what you'd be able to do with a fully cybernetic body.

Before the transfer he was in good health for his age, both mentally and physically. He was in a good place and didn't have any reasons to opt for the transfer other than curiosity and a bit of boredom really. There was no precursor for what happened after the transfer.

Pretty much from waking up in the new body, he "wasn't feeling it" as he put it. The transfer went smoothly, the body worked like a charm, but he was not keen on using it. He was depressed, way beyond what could have been a side effect of the transfer. It was five days until he took his life, and it might have been sooner, hadn't it been for the fact that killing yourself is considerably harder in a modern cybernetic body.

He left a note to his daughters saying this isn't working out for him and that he would now gladly join their mother and return to nothingness.
