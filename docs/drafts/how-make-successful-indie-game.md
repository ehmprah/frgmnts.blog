A few months ago I released [Core Defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203360/Core_Defense/) on Steam and grossed $20,186 in the first week. Nothing crazy, but good enough for a solo indie developer – especially if you take into account that you can expect to make 2-5x your first week's revenue during your first year ([according to](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SimonCarless/20200615/364798/Steam_the_new_wishlists_to_first_week_sales_expectations.php) Simon Carless, whose [newsletter](https://gamediscoverability.substack.com/) I cannot recommend enough.

Currently I am at around 2.5x of the first week's revenue and I haven't done a single sale on Steam yet, which will profit from more than twice the amount of wishlists I had at launch. And then the game's coming to Adnroid and iOS soon, so all in all I would call Core Defense a somewhat successful indie game so far.

In this post mortem (which is the more readable version of my [AMA on r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/i1oi1o/im_a_solo_indie_dev_my_new_game_just_make_3k_in/)) I will share my lessons learned and give you my take on why Core Defense became a modest success. Naturally this post will contain lots of dos – but if you're also interested in the don'ts, check out the [post mortem](https://frgmnts.blog/f/how-not-to-make-a-game.html) about my first failed game Coregrounds.

## Simplicity

Being a minimalist at heart, I like simple things. Unfortunately that didn't keep me from making my last game a complexity monster. This time around I wanted to make a game that's simple but highly replayable and strategically diverse – and I think its simplicity is one of the core reasons (pun intended) for its success. Core Defense has no tutorial and does not need one. Its simple, dopamine-rushing core loop: get rewards, update your build, survive the next wave, repeat.

Embracing simplicity allows you to easily communicate what your game is about and why people should care, which helps selling your game in the first place. Players can dive right in and get to the fun faster (only if your game is fun of course), meaning less churn, more positive reviews and ultimately even more sales. Oh and did I mention that simple games are not only faster to build and easier to maintain, but also much more fun to work on? Believe me, I did both and crawling back out of countless rabbit holes is way less fun than tending to a nice little zen garden of a game project.

## Quality

My first game failed for many reasons, the most important one: it was hemorrhaging players from the start. And it was not just the game's complexity I've mentioned above: apart from a terrible user experience the game had bugs and technical issues aplenty – all of which were completely avoidable roadblocks.

Quality is not everything, but without quality everything is nothing. With Core Defense I have tried to put quality first in every way possible. The concept and game design, the user experience, the store page – just about everything I did I tried to do as best as I could, reiterating and polishing as often as I reasonably could.

When talking about selling games and things, we always talk about how to gain more, grow more, reach more – but personally I think it's the wrong way to go about it. We have huge markets to tap into anyway and I think we should worry more about loosing people than about reaching more. By releasing a game on Steam, we get our games in front of thousands of people no matter what – so we should make sure we loose as few of those as we can.

With Core Defense I have tried to remove friction every step of the way: From the Steam capsule image to the game's user interface everything was designed to be as crystal clear and appealing and as much fun to use as possible.

## Community-driven development

For Core Defense I luckily chose a community-driven development approach. After finishing the concept I whipped up an alpha version of the game within two months and created a Discord server to get people to play it. I kickstarted the server by alerting my last game's community (from which Core Defense is spin-off after all) and gaming outlets like [AlphaBetaGamer](https://www.alphabetagamer.com/core-defense-alpha-download/).

And since then the Discord server has been constantly growing and has been an invaluable ressource for the game's development. Much of the content in the game today is based on player's ideas and feedback. Countless bugs and issues were reported and the community was and is an endless source of both motivation and inspiration.

One reason this was working so well though: I was actively engaged with the community, reading absolutely everything they posted and commenting on most of it. The same is true for the Steam community discussions, where there's virtually no post without feedback from me. So while it was a considerable amount of work, not a minute of it I spent in vain.

## Steam Store Page

as early as possible (wishlists!), as finetuned as possible

## Release Strategy

timeline: Worked on the concept for about 3 months then started developing last September. Had a public alpha out for about a month before I released it as early access on itch.io in mid January.

public alpha, beta on itch, release on steam

 (with a widget on itch.io to drive people to it)

## Localization

bigger audience. period. get most of it for free.
roughly 55% sales out of english speaking countries.

## Demo

more wishlists, feedback, if standalone even reviews – which for some ppl is the only feedback they'll ever give. by far the most effective marketing tool I've used for CD.

## Marketing

- influencer outreach: by far the most
- social media presence: find new fans, keep your old ones on board.
- press releases:
- press outreach: even if it's just for those 3 quotes on the store page
- forum posts
- giveaways
- sharing data, post mortems, amas are a win-win: others can learn, you can get more eyes on your game

I post a lot on my personal Twitter (#screenshotsaturday!)
I have a press list to which I sent out news, press releases and review keys
I had a hand-picked list of influencers whom I contacted via mail (to no avail alas)
I used dodistribute, Keymailer and Woovit for key requests
I posted to IndieDB and several forums regularly
I had a prelaunch demo on Steam whose organic Steam traffic converted nicely into wishlists (I wrote a blog post about why a prelaunch demo makes sense)
The game was developed with a community-driven approach, so the Discord server and the community were crucial
I did an Indieboost campaign for the Early Access launch on itch.io and spent about $200 on sponsored influencer videos
Before the Steam launch, I used Woovit to send out keys to influencers, got featured by a few smaller ones but no big reach here
Also did a Keymailer ad for $100 two weeks before the launch which netted about 80 key requests and a few videos, again not much reach here though
Spent a lot of time perfecting the store page to nail that first impression and make people look beyond the graphics

## Beware of the burnout

Being an indie dev is hard.

## Do tracking as early as possible!

the situation, caveat: burnout!

research? play a shitton of games?
