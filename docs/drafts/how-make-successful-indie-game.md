A few months ago I released [Core Defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203360/Core_Defense/) on Steam and grossed $20,186 in the first week. Nothing crazy, but good enough for a solo indie developer – especially if you take into account that you can expect to make 2-5x your first week's revenue during your first year ([according to](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SimonCarless/20200615/364798/Steam_the_new_wishlists_to_first_week_sales_expectations.php) Simon Carless, whose [newsletter](https://gamediscoverability.substack.com/) I cannot recommend enough).

Currently I am at around 2.5x of the first week's revenue and I haven't done a single sale on Steam, which will profit from more than twice the amount of wishlists I had at launch. So all in all I would call Core Defense a somewhat successful indie game.

In this post mortem (which is the more readable version of my [AMA on r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/i1oi1o/im_a_solo_indie_dev_my_new_game_just_make_3k_in/)) I will share my lessons learned and give you my take on why Core Defense became a modest success.

Naturally this post will contain lots of dos – but if you're also interested in the don'ts, check out the [post mortem](https://frgmnts.blog/f/how-not-to-make-a-game.html) about my first failed game Coregrounds.

## Quality

The single most important thing you can do to make your game a success is to put quality first – in every aspect of game development there is. Your concept, your game design, your interface design, your community management, your marketing, your store page – just about everything you do you should be the best you can possibly do.

When talking about selling games and things, we always talk about how to gain more, grow more, reach more – but personally I think it's the wrong way to go about it. We have huge markets to tap into anyway and I think you should worry more about loosing people than about reaching more.

By releasing a game on Steam, you will get your game in front of thousands of people no matter what – so what you want to make sure is that you loose as few of those as you can. Try to remove friction every step of the way. From your Steam capsule image to the game's interface everything should try to be as crystal clear, as appealing and as much fun to use as possible.

## Simplicity

To achieve high quality, keeping things simple helps a great deal. Identify what's really important and keep iterating on that. Core Defense has no tutorial and doesn't need one – and while I'm happy with the game as it is, I already know that my next game has to be so much more simple still.

Keeping things simple helps selling your game because you can exactly pinpoint what it's about. It helps people understand your game. Simplicity also massively helps planning, building and maintaining your game. Both quality and simplicity should be constant companions on your game development journey, perpetually challenging yourself: is this really the best and simplest solution to your problem?
