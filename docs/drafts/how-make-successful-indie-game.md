A few months ago I released [Core Defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203360/Core_Defense/) on Steam and grossed $20,186 in the first week. Nothing crazy, but good enough for a solo indie developer – especially if you take into account that you can expect to make 2-5x your first week's revenue during your first year ([according to](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SimonCarless/20200615/364798/Steam_the_new_wishlists_to_first_week_sales_expectations.php) Simon Carless, whose [newsletter](https://gamediscoverability.substack.com/) I cannot recommend enough).

Currently I am at around 2.5x of the first week's revenue and I haven't done a single sale on Steam, which will profit from more than twice the amount of wishlists I had at launch. And the mobile versions haven't

So all in all I would call Core Defense a somewhat successful indie game.

In this post mortem (which is the more readable version of my [AMA on r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/i1oi1o/im_a_solo_indie_dev_my_new_game_just_make_3k_in/)) I will share my lessons learned and give you my take on why Core Defense became a modest success.

Naturally this post will contain lots of dos – but if you're also interested in the don'ts, check out the [post mortem](https://frgmnts.blog/f/how-not-to-make-a-game.html) about my first failed game Coregrounds.

## SIMPLICIY FIRST!

## Quality

My first game failed for many reasons, the most important one: it was hemorrhaging players from the start. It was too complex, not at all easy to learn, there were bugs and technical issues – all along the way I lost players by the thousands to completely avoidable roadblocks. This time around, I wanted to get it right and tried to make a game as simple and as good as possible.

In my humble opinion ...

The single most important thing you can do to make your game a success is to put quality first in every aspect of game development. Your concept, your game design, your interface design, your community management, your marketing, your store page – just about everything you do you should be the best you can possibly do.

When talking about selling games and things, we always talk about how to gain more, grow more, reach more – but personally I think it's the wrong way to go about it. We have huge markets to tap into anyway and I think you should worry more about loosing people than about reaching more.

By releasing a game on Steam, you will get your game in front of thousands of people no matter what – so what you want to make sure is that you loose as few of those as you can. Try to remove friction every step of the way. From your Steam capsule image to the game's interface everything should try to be as crystal clear, as appealing and as much fun to use as possible.

TODO: MERGE quality & simplicity

## Simplicity

"making the game dead simple with a dopamine-rushing core hook but high replayability and strategic diversity"

To achieve high quality, keeping things simple helps a great deal. Identify what's really important and keep iterating on that. Core Defense has no tutorial and doesn't need one – and while I'm happy with the game as it is, I already know that my next game has to be so much more simple still.

Keeping things simple helps selling your game because you can exactly pinpoint what it's about. It helps people understand your game. Simplicity also massively helps planning, building and maintaining your game.

Both quality and simplicity should be constant companions on your game development journey, perpetually challenging yourself: is this really the best and simplest solution to your problem?

## Community-driven development

The Discord had about 200 people, 30-50 of which were very active.
community-driven development: the game is SO much better thanks to all the ideas from the community, which I actively ask for and try to quickly implement
customer service mentality

## Steam Store Page

as early as possible (wishlists!), as finetuned as possible

## Release Strategy

timeline: Worked on the concept for about 3 months then started developing last September. Had a public alpha out for about a month before I released it as early access on itch.io in mid January.

public alpha, beta on itch, release on steam

 (with a widget on itch.io to drive people to it)

## Localization

bigger audience. period. get most of it for free.
roughly 55% sales out of english speaking countries.

## Demo

more wishlists, feedback, if standalone even reviews – which for some ppl is the only feedback they'll ever give. by far the most effective marketing tool I've used for CD.

## Marketing

- influencer outreach: by far the most
- social media presence: find new fans, keep your old ones on board.
- press releases:
- press outreach: even if it's just for those 3 quotes on the store page
- forum posts
- giveaways
- sharing data, post mortems, amas are a win-win: others can learn, you can get more eyes on your game

I post a lot on my personal Twitter (#screenshotsaturday!)
I have a press list to which I sent out news, press releases and review keys
I had a hand-picked list of influencers whom I contacted via mail (to no avail alas)
I used dodistribute, Keymailer and Woovit for key requests
I posted to IndieDB and several forums regularly
I had a prelaunch demo on Steam whose organic Steam traffic converted nicely into wishlists (I wrote a blog post about why a prelaunch demo makes sense)
The game was developed with a community-driven approach, so the Discord server and the community were crucial
I did an Indieboost campaign for the Early Access launch on itch.io and spent about $200 on sponsored influencer videos
Before the Steam launch, I used Woovit to send out keys to influencers, got featured by a few smaller ones but no big reach here
Also did a Keymailer ad for $100 two weeks before the launch which netted about 80 key requests and a few videos, again not much reach here though
Spent a lot of time perfecting the store page to nail that first impression and make people look beyond the graphics

## Beware of the burnout

Being an indie dev is hard.

## Do tracking as early as possible!

the situation, caveat: burnout!

research? play a shitton of games?
