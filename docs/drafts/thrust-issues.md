"It's a weird story. I know that the entire question of how much reality is behind the fiction is bullshit mostly, but I still can't help but wonder wether you actually do that. I wonder if you've done that yourself and slapped your penis against every piece of dinnerware on this table."

"I know, man, I know, and that's the fucking beauty of it. You'll never know, you will never really know wether I did or didn't."

"But even if it's just a constructed kind of thing, it's very specific, I mean how do you even come up with the idea of someone who'll slap his dick against the tableware in that compulsive kind of way?"

"It was actually very easy to do. I wanted to write a story about the fact that you never fucking know, with anyone. Your best friend could be conspiring against you, any time. I mean fuck, you can't even trust yourself, really. And I wanted to capture this feeling in an eerie kind of way, that's also quirky and likable."

"What's to like about your host slapping your plates with his penis?!"

"It's not about that, it's about the protagonist doing that as opposed to, I don't know, slowly poisoning everyone or harming them in an actual physical kind of way."

"So we should be glad that our host is 'only' slapping his penis against the dishes we're eating from? I don't know, man, I get the feeling you wanted to transport, but I don't love the fact that you had to do it in a way that has me wondering about your actual dick on my actual plate."

"I think it's brilliant for that exact reason. Because you know, you could ask me and we could talk about it and I could swear and still there will be a sliver of doubt left in your head. You'd maybe think of it again later, in your bed, and wonder whether I said the truth because there's just no fucking way for you to ever truly know. That's why I love the story. I think it's powerful shit. It's not about me slapping my penis against the dishes, it's really about you valuing something else more than the risk that I could have penis-slapped your cutlery."

"I do get it, man, I get the concept behind the story. I just think it's weird, that's all."
