It has been only a few days since the Transnational Government officially announced the Endurance mission has failed and the 48 souls aboard the ship are presumed dead. Everybody had known the consequences for months: Should the last of the three colonization missions fail, the Catharsis programme would be set in motion. But now that it’s actually happening, the entire Mindnet is throbbing with disbelief and shock.

Which is nonsense in my opinion; we had it coming all along, just like we did back then at the beginning of the millennium, when humanity was actually discussing whether the global warming is even happening. Well we now know it did, and in a couple of years humans will be looking back in history with nothing but disdain for our simplicity.

I for one plan to be one of the few looking back. I will not be one of the millions to be randomly paired with a male just to be shot into space for an unfathomably tiny chance of hitting a piece of inhabitable rock, successfully land there and start a human colony somewhere in the giant void that is our universe.

I don’t think that a single one of these millions of colonization capsules will ever be more than two frozen humans floating in space forever. How should two humans in a tiny automated capsule ever accomplish to colonize space if three full-blown space missions failed so miserably?

Neither will I be among the billions of people being randomly cut off from their life support for the greater good. It’s not that I don’t understand that it’s just not possible to sustain 16 billion human lives in survival pods at the bottom of the sea forever. It makes a whole lot of sense: why should the entire species die within a year, if a small fraction of them could live for hundreds of years instead? It’s just that I want to be among the million people left on earth after the Catharsis programme is finished.

Especially as a podbirth I think I do at least deserve a chance of getting out of this thing some day. I’ve never actually seen my own body with my own eyes. It doesn’t help that everyone who has walked before tells me the Mindnet is about as real as reality gets, and that my body looks and feels exactly like I experience it on the net – but I still want to see that for myself you know? I don’t ever need to eat, I don’t necessarily have to have sex, but at least I’d like to look down and see my actual own body one day.

Which is why I enrolled in the Coregrounds: it is one of the competitive programmes which are part of Catharsis. If you’re good, your pod does not take part in the shutdown lottery, and if you’re not, you’re getting shut down directly. So instead of just relying on luck, you can take fate in your own hands.

I know that you won’t be psyched to see your daughter “risk” her life that way – but honestly, I’d rather die knowing that I just wasn’t good enough instead of dying because some machine picked a random number which happens to represent me.

And apart from my personal opinion on the matter, this decision also is a pragmatic one: I’ve been competing in Mindnet games for as long as I can remember, and you know I’m good at it. I know that there are other programmes within Catharsis which are probably less popular than the games, which in turn might increase my chances of coming up on top, but honestly, if I’m going to be competing for my survival, I might as well have fun doing it. I hope that you can understand my decision and will support me in fighting for my life.

Love,

Lea
