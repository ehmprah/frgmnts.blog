ADD TRAILER OR BOX ART HERE!

Yesterday my third, mostly solo developed indie game Blacken Slash was released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746560?utm_source=website), [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ehmprah.blackenslash) and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/blacken-slash/id1604646442). In this post I'll share some early numbers and the lessons I learned making this game over the past 12 months.

ADD_NUMBERS_HERE

## Godot: Do again!

Surprise surprise, using a game engine to make games makes a ton of things a lot easier. After making [Coregrounds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/649770/Coregrounds/) and [Core Defense](https://coredefense.ehmprah.com/) with HTML5 and [ultimately being annoyed](https://frgmnts.blog/f/multi-platform-games-javascript.html) I have switched over to Godot for this one – and I haven't looked back. Godot is outstanding open source software which I love and cannot recommend enough.

## Quality: Do again!

You cannot control if a famous streamer picks up your game or if press is going to cover it. What you do control is the quality of your product. Quality is not everything, but without quality, everything is nothing. The Core Defense mobile versions netted me 30k only on reviews and algorithm-assisted word of mouth.

Marketing games in the attention economy is exceedingly hard, so you have to make every sale count. I want a sale to become a multiplier for more sales. To that end I have spent twice as much time as planned on this game, but I'd definitely do that again.

## Hook: Do better!

I love Diablo – but I can't play games that require so much clicking anymore. I prefer turn-based games nowadays, so I decided to make a mashup of both. "Diablo, but turn-based" isn't the worst hook imaginable, but it sure isn't the best either. And the game's abstract retro theme doesn't exactly scream "Diablo". In the first iteration the game was called "Paint it Black", but I realized too late that name was taken on Steam – but some design choices remained.

Especially the worldbuilding and marketing were unnecessarily hard because of the fact that Blacken Slash has grown organically around the basic gameplay idea. It's hard to describe in one sentence or picture. Things could have been so much easier with a captivating point of view and with a hook that's so strong that a two second GIF is all you need to understand what the game is.

## Localization: Do better!

I was [ultimately disappointed](https://frgmnts.blog/f/one-year-core-defense-numbers-learnings.html) with the crowdsourced localization strategy for Core Defense. This time around I used friends and paid translators for fewer, but better translations of the game. I'm happy with the results but learned that I could have saved quite a bit of time by amending the strings with some extra context and descriptions for the translators.

## Price: We'll see!

For my last game Core Defense I opted for a $9.99 price point and frequent and high discounts. I was satisfied with the results but had quite some backlash about the price in the reviews, especially given the fact that it's not exactly a looker.

This time around I wanted to try a new strategy, inspired by the success of SNKRX and Vampire Survivors and similar low-priced titles. Blacken Slash is richer than Core Defense both visually and content-wise, but I'm selling it for $4.99 – mainly because I want as low an entry barrier as possible so I can use the aforementioned quality to turn sales into reviews and subsequently into more sales.

ADD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FIRST 24H CONVERSIONS!

## Release Strategy: Do Better!

The Core Defense release strategy was very successful: a closed alpha sparked interest, an Early Access via itch.io built a community (and the game) and then a prologue on Steam brought thousands of wishlists before the launch.

I wanted to replicate that success but unfortunately changed some things for the worse: Because I wanted to take part in the Steam Next Fest, I opted for a demo instead of a prologue. And I released this demo even before the itch.io Early Access. This is what happened:

- I got tons of feedback from the demo already, essentially making the Early Access unnecessary
- The demo performed worse than Core Defense's prologue because it was released with much less polish
- Two months before the release I still sat at 1k wishlists, panicked and did make a prologue after all, which didn't do anything for the game

Even though I used exactly the same tools, the order made a huge difference. I would still go for a demo first, but probably skip the itch.io EA and use a prologue released in EA on Steam.

## Marketing

Core Defense was successful enough for me to make another game – but not successful enough to pay for much marketing. Here's a list of things I did and what I learned:

- **Discord**<br>With Core Defense I built a cool community on Discord and expected to be able to convert them to Blacken Slash easily. Turns out a Discord server is not a reliable way of reaching your fans: when they're "done" with the game most people will either leave or mute the server.
- **Mailing List**<br>After realizing I had no way of contacting most of my previous fans, I added a newsletter subscription to the end of the demo, incentivised with the promise of a special subscriber item they get upon launch. It's a shame I only started doing this on my THIRD game.
- **Twitter**<br>The social I'm using most successfully with hashtags like #ScreenshotSaturday, #PitchYaGame and #TurnBasedThursday. Also: the game's sound designer actually [approached me via Twitter](https://twitter.com/ehmprah/status/1429038571147735050), the game's name was [decided on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ehmprah/status/1433032768146051079), and [recruited content creators for a pre-alpha](https://twitter.com/ehmprah/status/1466789369679908868)
