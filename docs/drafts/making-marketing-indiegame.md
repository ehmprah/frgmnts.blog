Yesterday my third, mostly solo developed indie game Blacken Slash was released on Steam, Play Store and App Store. In this post I'll share some early numbers and the lessons I learned making this game over the past year.

## Godot rocks

After making [Coregrounds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/649770/Coregrounds/) and [Core Defense](https://coredefense.ehmprah.com/) with HTML5 and [ultimately being annoyed](https://frgmnts.blog/f/multi-platform-games-javascript.html) I have switched over to Godot for this one – and I haven't looked back. Godot is outstanding open source software which I love and cannot recommend enough. And surprise surprise, using a game engine to make games makes a ton of things a lot easier.

## Quality

I've already talked about this pillar of my game development philosophy in the [Core Defense post-mortem](https://frgmnts.blog/f/how-make-successful-indie-game.html) – but I can't stress the importance of delivering high quality enough. Marketing games in the attention economy is exceedingly hard, so you have to make every sale count. Every sale is a potential review – and with every review the store's algorithm will send more or fewer eyeballs your way. You cannot control if a famous streamer picks up your game or if press is going to cover it. What you do control is the quality of the product you're making. Quality is not everything, but without quality, everything is nothing.

Blacken Slash was planned as a quick side project to pay for other, more ambitious games I am working on. I expected it to be done in less than six months but needed a year in the end. Feature creep or learning a new engine barely made a dent here, it was all finetuning and reworking stuff I wasn't satisfied with yet. Time will tell if this was a sound investment.

But let me end this with a little anecdote from Core Defense: the mobile versions were not doing all too well until I added a review prompt to the game – and with the reviews came the traffic and the sales; without any other marketing whatsoever I netted over 30k in the past year.

## Hook

I love Diablo – but I can't play games that require so much clicking anymore. I prefer turn-based games nowadays, so I decided to make a mashup of both. "Diablo, but turn-based" isn't the worst hook imaginable, but it sure isn't the best either. And the game's abstract retro theme doesn't exactly scream "Diablo". In the first iteration the game was called "Paint it Black", but I realized too late that name was taken on Steam – but some design choices remained.

Especially the narrative and the marketing were unnecessarily hard because of the fact that Blacken Slash has grown organically and sometimes backwards around the gameplay idea. To this day I have trouble describing the game in one sentence. As you can see it all worked out, but things could have been so much easier with a clear point of view, with an idea of a story, with a why, with a hook that's so strong that a two second GIF is all you need to understand what the game is.


## Price

For my last game Core Defense I opted for a $9.99 price point and frequent and high discounts. I was satisfied with the results but had quite some backlash about the price in the reviews, especially given the fact that it's not exactly a looker.

This time around I wanted to try a new strategy, inspired by the success of SNKRX and Vampire Survivors and similar low-priced titles. Blacken Slash is richer than Core Defense both visually and content-wise, but I'm selling it for $4.99 – mainly because I want as low an entry barrier as possible so I can use the aforementioned quality to turn sales into reviews and subsequently into more sales.

## Marketing

Core Defense was successful enough for me to make another game – but not successful enough to pay for much marketing. Here's a list of things I did and what I think of the impact:
