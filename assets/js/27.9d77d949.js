To be honest it's been really hard these past couple of months, ever since I've committed to lifestreaming full time. There are many things that are hard about it but nothing quite like the sex. I mean meeting people who are obviously into you, you know where you just KNOW they like you as well and if the situation would allow it you'd be all over each other but then they naturally aren't willing to have sex with me because of my lifestreaming. One said that even if it weren't for all my followers experiencing it with me it would still feel weird for them having sex with thousands of people they're not feeling themselves but they know are in it at any given moment. Anyway it's obviously been ages since I've been laid and I can't thank you enough for having sex with me. See I'm so desperate I'll even thank you before we do it. But I'm also very curious how both of our followers like it. This is really exciting fringe stuff! I mean thousands of people caught in both sides of the act that's some intense stuff to wrap your head around, isn't it?")])],1)}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
