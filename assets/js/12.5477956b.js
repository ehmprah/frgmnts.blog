There were even political parties which made animal rights their main concern. Once the Global Government passed the Animal Freedom Act, most of them vanished of course, because what would you fight for if the bill made sure no animal would ever been used by humans again. There were some groups which kept fighting because they found natural animal life without human intervention too cruel and basically wanted to turn all the world's animals into pets, but also they disbanded shortly after and yeah, animals lived happily ever after. I think it's weird anyway that there was so much support for a cause which just made sense at some point â€” if you could produce everything without animals, why continue to use them? And back then they didn't even have replicators! Anyway my point being that now that we do have replicators, why isn't the use of plants forbidden as well? We clearly don't need them, so why isn't there a lobby for plants? Because they don't have cute faces when they're babies? Don't you think that's a little weird?")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=o.exports}}]);
