Core Defense had more than <a href="https://frgmnts.blog/f/core-defense-launch-numbers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twice the wishlists before launch<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>; I think the reason for that is my botched release strategy but more on that below. In the first 24 hours on sale Blacken Slash grossed $1,116:</p> <ul><li><strong>Steam</strong>: $488 from 114 copies (78% were wishlist conversions)</li> <li><strong>App Store</strong>: $565 from 107 copies (39% were pre-orders)</li> <li><strong>Play Store</strong>: $63 from 14 copies</li></ul> <p>To be perfectly honest I'm not blown away by the results. But then the strategy for this one was focused on the long tail anyway: Deliver high quality at a low price to gain good reviews to please the allmighty algorithm. And the numbers are good enough for me to stay a full-time indie for a while I guess – and that was the whole point of this exercise.</p> <h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2> <p>For my last game Core Defense I opted for a $9.99 price point and frequent and high discounts. I was satisfied with the results but had quite some backlash about the price in the reviews, especially given the fact that it's not exactly a looker.</p> <p>This time around I wanted to try a new strategy, inspired by the success of SNKRX and Vampire Survivors and similar low-priced titles. Blacken Slash is richer than Core Defense both visually and content-wise, but I'm selling it for $4.99. I did this for three reasons:</p> <ul><li>I hate price differences between PC and mobile but felt $4.99 was the ceiling for mobile, so I wanted the PC version to cost just that</li> <li>I wanted a low entry barrier so I could hook impulse buyers with my high quality game</li> <li>I wanted players to feel they got a good deal, which will be reflected in the reviews</li></ul> <h2 id="mobile">Mobile</h2> <p>There are two things to unpack regarding the mobile versions. After trying freemium with Core Defense I wanted to try how a premium game with a separate demo would work on mobile. Looking at the early numbers this seems viable.</p> <p>Coming from a web development background I always wanted to make games which work on both desktop and mobile devices. With just a little more effort you can have the same product reach a bigger audience and market, so why not do it?</p> <p>Turns out it isn't exactly easy: it took me almost ten years and three games to realize my vision of responsive game development. For Coregrounds mobile versions were planned but cancelled with the game. Core Defense had mobile versions but almost a year after the Steam release. Only with Blacken Slash I finally managed a simship – and I'm happy the mobile sales are more than on par with the Steam sales.</p> <h2 id="godot">Godot</h2> <p>Surprise surprise, using a game engine to make games makes a ton of things a lot easier.

Godot is outstanding open source software which I love and cannot recommend enough – especially if you're developing for mobile as well!</p> <h2 id="quality">Quality</h2> <p>You cannot control if a famous streamer picks up your game or if press is going to cover it. What you do control is the quality of your product. Quality is not everything, but without quality, everything is nothing. The Core Defense mobile versions netted me 30k only on reviews and algorithm-assisted word of mouth.</p> <p>Marketing games in the attention economy is exceedingly hard, so you have to make every sale count. I want a sale to become a multiplier for more sales. To that end I have spent twice as much time as planned on this game, but I'd definitely do that again.</p> <h2 id="hook">Hook</h2> <p>I love Diablo – but I can't play games that require so much clicking anymore. I prefer turn-based games nowadays, so I decided to make a mashup of both. &quot;Diablo, but turn-based&quot; isn't the worst hook imaginable, but it sure isn't the best either. And the game's abstract retro theme doesn't exactly scream &quot;Diablo&quot;. In the first iteration the game was called &quot;Paint it Black&quot;, but I realized too late that name was taken on Steam – but some design choices remained.</p> <p>Especially the worldbuilding and marketing were unnecessarily hard because of the fact that Blacken Slash has grown organically around the basic gameplay idea. It's hard to describe in one sentence or picture. Things could have been so much easier with a captivating point of view and with a hook that's so strong that a two second GIF is all you need to understand what the game is.</p> <h2 id="worldbuilding">Worldbuilding</h2> <p>Michael Champion composed the soundtrack for Blacken Slash and penned the narrative. The worldbuilding we did together – but looking back I think we went a bit overboard: while established tropes and names for things may be boring, they sure increase a game's accessibility. There's a sweet spot between fresh and alienating which we haven't quite nailed with this one.</p> <h2 id="localization">Localization</h2> <p>I was <a href="https://frgmnts.blog/f/one-year-core-defense-numbers-learnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimately disappointed<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> with the crowdsourced localization strategy for Core Defense. This time around I used friends and paid translators for fewer, but better translations of the game. I'm happy with the results but learned that I could have saved quite a bit of time by amending the strings with some extra context and descriptions for the translators.</p> <h2 id="release-strategy">Release Strategy</h2> <p>The Core Defense release strategy was very successful: a closed alpha sparked interest, an Early Access via itch.io built a community (and the game) and then a prologue on Steam brought thousands of wishlists before the launch.</p> <p>I wanted to replicate that success but unfortunately changed some things for the worse: Because I wanted to take part in the Steam Next Fest, I opted for a demo instead of a prologue. And I released this demo even before the itch.io Early Access. This is what happened:</p> <ul><li>I got tons of feedback from the demo already, essentially making the Early Access unnecessary</li> <li>The demo performed worse than Core Defense's prologue because it was released with much less polish</li> <li>Two months before the release I still sat at 1k wishlists, panicked and did make a prologue after all, which didn't much for the game</li></ul> <p>Even though I used exactly the same tools, the order made a huge difference. I would still go for a demo first, but probably skip the itch.io EA and use a prologue released in EA on Steam. Furthermore I'd continue sharing early progress on socials, but do the announcement and Steam page at a later point in development. I don't think an early, unpolished version on Steam will hurt your wishlists, but it sure is a lot of work updating it as your game progresses. The amount of time I spent on trailers, screenshots and GIFs for Blacken Slash was <strong>too damn high</strong>.</p> <h2 id="marketing">Marketing</h2> <p>Core Defense was successful enough for me to make another game – but not successful enough to pay for much marketing. Here's a list of things I did and what I learned:</p> <ul><li><strong>Store Page</strong><br>Apart from the product itself, the store page is <em>the</em> most valuable marketing tool you have. Make sure it's as good as can be. I've spent <em>weeks</em> perfecting the copy and assets.</li> <li><strong>Discord</strong><br>With Core Defense I built a cool community on Discord and expected to be able to convert them to Blacken Slash easily. Turns out a Discord server is not a reliable way of reaching your fans: when they're &quot;done&quot; with the game most people will either leave or mute the server. You should definitely have a Discord server, just not as your <em>only</em> point of contact with your fans.</li> <li><strong>Mailing List</strong><br>After realizing I had no way of contacting most of my previous fans, I added a newsletter subscription to the end of the demo, incentivised with the promise of a special subscriber item they get upon launch. A very powerful tool which I should have started using <em>much</em> earlier!</li> <li><strong>Steam Next Fest</strong><br>The Next Fest was the main reason I opted for a demo instead of a prologue but I've been disappointed. I did two livestreams and only gained around a 100 wishlists during the Next Fest. Instead of the February iteration I should have gone for the June one to showcase a more polished version but I think even then the results would probably have been underwhelming. I think the Next Fest is more valuable the more traction you have before it.</li> <li><strong>Gameround.co</strong><br>I applied for a free spot on <a href="https://gameround.co/detail/230/info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gameround.co<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> to get feedback on the game's demo.
